<p align="center"> In this collaborative project, we delved into the realm of advanced web application development by harnessing the power of micro-frameworks. Our collective task involved crafting a dating site in a language of our choosing, placing a strong emphasis on user interactions as the project's focal point. This dynamic dating website enables users to create personalized profiles, explore other user profiles, express interest through likes, and initiate conversations through a chat feature when mutual interest is reciprocated.</p>
